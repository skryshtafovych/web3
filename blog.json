        "text": "Imagine your website like a book. In the old internet (what we now call Web2), that book lived in one giant, very fancy library building (a traditional server). If that library had a problem – a power outage, a fire, or if someone decided they didn't like your book and locked the doors – then no one could read it. Your website would be down. And for people to even find this specific library, there's a big, central phone book service (DNS) that tells everyone its exact street address."

        "text": "Instead of one central library, your website's content (all the words, pictures, and how it looks, which are just basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files) is copied and stored across hundreds, even thousands, of different computers all over the world. This is what we call IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)."

      {
        "type": "analogy",
        "text": "Imagine you have a famous family recipe. Instead of keeping the only copy in your personal recipe box (a single server), you've given a copy to every trusted friend, family member, and neighbor. If your house (the central server) goes dark, everyone else still has a copy! This means your website is incredibly resilient. It's almost impossible to take down, censor, or lose because so many different \"keepers\" hold a piece of it. No single company or government can simply flip a switch and make it disappear."

      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "In the old internet, a website's address (like stepank.com) pointed to a physical location – that one big library building. If the library moved, the address had to be updated, and sometimes old links would break. With IPFS, your website gets a unique \"content fingerprint.\" It's like your recipe isn't found by saying \"It's at Grandma's house,\" but by saying \"It's the recipe that tastes exactly like this, no matter whose kitchen it's in.\" This fingerprint is a permanent, unchangeable identifier for your site. Now, to make that fingerprint easy to remember, we use ENS (Ethereum Name Service)."
      },
      {
        "type": "analogy",
        "text": "ENS is like giving that unique \"recipe fingerprint\" a memorable, easy-to-say nickname, like stepank.eth. So instead of a long, confusing code, you just type stepank.eth, and your browser knows exactly which \"recipe\" (website) to find, no matter which \"kitchen\" (computer) is serving it up! This \"nickname\" lives on a global, public registry that no single company controls, making it truly yours."

When your website needs information (like an update, or a list of items), it makes tiny, quick \"API calls.\""

        "text": "Imagine your website is a detective. Instead of going to one central police station (a traditional database) to get all its clues, it sends out tiny, encrypted messages to a vast network of other trusted detectives (decentralized data sources). Each detective only provides the specific piece of information asked for, and it's all verified by the network, not by a single boss. This makes everything transparent and secure. You're not relying on one company to guard all the secrets; the whole community is involved."
