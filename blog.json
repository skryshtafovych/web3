Production environments like Google App Engine often run `npm install --omit=dev`, skipping these dependencies.\n\n**The Solution:** We manually edited the `package.json` file to move both `vite` and `@vitejs/plugin-react` from `devDependencies` to the main `dependencies` section, ensuring they would be installed in the production environment."

Google App Engine runs your application in a read-only filesystem. Our `start` script at the time (`npm run build && node server.js`) was trying to build the project inside this read-only environment, causing it to crash.\n\n**The Solution:** This required separating the **build step** from the **run step**. We leveraged a feature of Google Cloud Build by adding a special script to our `package.json` called `gcp-build`. When deploying, Google Cloud runs this script in a temporary, *writable* environment. We then changed the `start` script back to its simple, single purpose of `node server.js`."

Our server was hardcoded to listen on port `3001`, but Google App Engine assigns a port dynamically via the `PORT` environment variable.\n\n**The Solution:** A simple but critical one-line change in `server.js`:\n`const port = process.env.PORT || 3001;`\nThis makes the server respect the environment's assigned port while still allowing it to run on port 3001 for local development."

However, there's a twist: reverse polarity (RP) connectors. An RP-SMA male connector, for example, will have a barrel like a standard male SMA, but instead of a center pin, it will have a receptacle. This was intended to prevent consumers from connecting antennas that could damage the device, but it can be a source of confusion."

Using an antenna that isn't tuned for the correct frequency will result in poor performance. Additionally, antennas have different radiation patterns. Some are omnidirectional, sending and receiving signals in all directions, while others are directional, focusing the signal in a specific direction. The right antenna for the job depends on your specific application."
